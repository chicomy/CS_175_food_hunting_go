Machine Learning Project in MineCraft

Authors: Chongming Wang, Zeyang Li, Yifan Zhang

Our agent is designed to learn about corresponding relationship between terrain blocks and objects on it, and it will apply what it has learnt in a more complex map to find objects it is asked for. It is like an auto-robot for searching required objects in places that human cannot reach, such as deep forest or seafloor. It will optimize its path while it is searching. 
On the right side is a training map, which is divided into four pieces with objects on it. Most objects are bind onto a certain type of block, but there are outliers just to confuse our agent. Expect some unexpected.
